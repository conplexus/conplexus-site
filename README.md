## Analytics (GA4) ‚Äî opt-in

This site uses Google Analytics 4 (GA4) only when a visitor explicitly opts in. Analytics are
loaded dynamically after consent and can be revoked at any time via the "Analytics settings"
control in the site footer.

Environment variable

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` ‚Äî set this to your GA4 Measurement ID (looks like `G-XXXXXXX`).
  - Locally: create a `.env.local` at the repo root with:

```powershell
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXX
```

    - On Vercel: add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in the project Environment Variables (Preview and Production as needed).

Testing the opt-in flow

- Start the dev server: `npm run dev` and open the site in an Incognito window.
- The consent banner will prompt for analytics. Accepting will inject the GA script (no data sent until enabled).
- To verify: open DevTools ‚Üí Network, filter by `gtag` or `googletagmanager.com/gtag/js` to see the script load. You can also watch console logs for analytics enable/disable messages.

Privacy and data collected

- We only collect aggregated, non-identifying analytics such as page views, referral sources, and basic event data to help improve the site. No PII is intentionally collected by our analytics setup.
